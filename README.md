__Physical computing Arduino:__ 

It is about learning the Arduino by Tinkercad and how to use it by building blogs and codes. Learning to communicate with people with light in daily life. 

Arduino is a funny way to learn more about programming how can we communicate with audiences by using computing. Understand more about the circuit of creating sensors and LEDs on and off. It is related to what we use daily, for example, sensor light in the bathroom, traffic light, sign board outside the shop…

__Build status:__

Through the Tinkercad, you may find some problems by making the light on using Arduino, be careful of the unit when you want to turn on and off the light, there will be two units, “seconds” and “milliseconds”. Also, remember to double-check for the order of the blogs, you may mix up with the blog of “high” and “low”. “High” represent “light on”, “Low” represents “light off”. So “High” should be the first, and then “Low”. Add the control blog between these two blogs, to let the light last for a few secs.

__Code style:__

In Tinkercad, we are using C++  to build the system of the circuit.

__Tech/Frame used__

The circuit are using Arduino to be the base, and using blogs "Output", "Control", "Notation", "Math" and "Variable".

__Installation:__

Through the project, we are using Tinkercad webside to play with the circuit. (Link: https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/project-gallery;collectionId=OMOZACHJ9IR8LRE)

__How to use ?__

1. First open the Tinkercad website and sign up. 
2. Create a new circuit in the circuit colume. 
3. Follow the steps and create the circuit by draging the components. 
4. Build the system using the blogs. 
5. Press "Start stimulation"
